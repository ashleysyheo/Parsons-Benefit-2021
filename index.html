                        <p>
                            Born in Uruguay, Gabriela Hearst grew up on her family’s ranch, Santa Isabel in Paysandu, surrounded by horses, cattle and sheep, where the notion of luxury meant things were beautifully 
                            crafted and made to last. In Fall 2015, Gabriela launched her eponymous label with the aim to create a brand that reflects a slower pace and process: where things are made with care and 
                            detail, where tradition is more important than trend, where there is a purpose to every piece. Gabriela’s commitment is to make a strong and modern collection without compromising her 
                            ethics and key values, taking into consideration where materials come from and who is making them: luxury with a conscience or in other words, “honest luxury”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Gabriela is the winner of the 2016/17 International Woolmark Prize for Womenswear and the 2018 recipient of the Pratt Institute Fashion Visionary Award. She was nominated in 2017 for the CFDA 
                            Swarovski Award for Emerging Talent and in March 2018 received a nomination for the CFDA Womenswear Designer of the Year. In 2018, she was appointed to the Board of Trustees of Save the Children. 
                            In December 2020, Gabriela Hearst was named the new Creative Director at Chloé.
